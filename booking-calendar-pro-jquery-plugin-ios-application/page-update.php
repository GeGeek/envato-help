                    <h6>Update</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To update the Plugin, login to <a href="http://www.codecanyon.net/?ref=DOTonPAPER">CodeCanyon</a>, head over to your <strong>Downloads</strong> section and re-download the plugin like you did when you bought it.</li>
                        <li>
                            Extract the zip's contents, look for the extracted plugin folder, and after you have all the new files upload them using FTP to the <strong>dopbcp</strong> folder overwriting the old ones (this is why it's important to backup any changes you've made to the plugin files).
                            <br /><br />
                            After, you add the settings and content files from the backup you did earlier.
