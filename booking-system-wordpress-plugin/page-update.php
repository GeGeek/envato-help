                    <h6>Latest Version: 2.0</h6>
                    
                    <h6>Important</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make a <strong>backup</strong> of the Plugin inside your WordPress installation folder <strong>/wp-content/plugins/dopbsp/</strong>.</li>
                        <li>If you update from version 1.9 to 2.0, change admin language back to the default one (English).</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h6>Warning</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do not delete the old files because it is possible to lose some of your data!</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h6>Update</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To update the Plugin, login to <a href="http://www.codecanyon.net/?ref=DOTonPAPER">CodeCanyon</a>, head over to your <strong>Downloads</strong> section and re-download the plugin like you did when you bought it.</li>
                        <li>
                            Extract the zip's contents, look for the extracted plugin folder, and after you have all the new files upload them using FTP to the <strong>/wp-content/plugins/dopbsp/</strong> folder overwriting the old ones (this is why it's important to backup any changes you've made to the plugin files).
                            <br /><br />
                            If you didn't make any changes to the plugin files, you are free to overwrite them with the new ones without the risk of losing any plugins settings, and backwards compatibility is guaranteed.
                        </li>
